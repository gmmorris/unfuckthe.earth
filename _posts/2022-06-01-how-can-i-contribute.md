description: "How can I contribute?"
---

Several months before the pandemic threw everything into chaos, [I made the following observation](https://gidi.io/tech-ethics/2019/05/08/tech-civilisations-circle-of-influence/):

{% include quote.html content="The untapped potential of many of our creative minds to solving climate change due to the lack of economic incentives, is a personal gripe of mine. I am as much at fault as anyone, as I chose to invest my time and effort into AdTech rather than climate change due to the clear difference in income potential. A choice I hope to rectify in the future." %}

Now that things are calming down, I'm beginning to explore what it means for folks such as myself to shift their focus to the climate. This blog is documenting what I learn, as I learn it, in the hope that it can help other engineers answer the following question: _How can I, as a software engineer, contribute to the global effort of decarbonisation?_

Sorry it took me so long.
Better late than never.
